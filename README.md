Browsing on Instagram without signing-in has been restricted recently and we get the below popup demanding to sign-in after scrolling through the photos a bit:

I built a very simple Chrome and Firefox extensions to let me bypass that restriction, and it's working for me very well, so I made it available for everyone. It does only this one thing and nothing more. No need for any configuration. The code is very simple, just one file with two mutation observers.
